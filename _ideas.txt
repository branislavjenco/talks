Ideas for talks

Used:
What's cooking for JavaScript: a look at current TC39 proposals (accepted NDC Oslo 2019)
  In this lightning talk, I go over the current proposals for new language features
  in JavaScript and their current status. Pipelines, decorators, null coalescing
  and more is coming, but when? And how will it look like?

Ununsed:

Lisp up your JavaScript - Compile time transformations with Babel Macros
  With the widespread use of tools like Babel, JavaScript is effectively becoming a compiled language. 
  Babel Macros allows us to easily define custom code transformations to speed up development or create DSLs. 
  In this lightning talk, I will go over how they work and go through coding a simple example.

"Functional core, imperative shell" in React apps
  In this lightning talk, I look at how the traditional "functional core, imperative shell"
  type of architecture (also known as hexagonal architecture) meshes with React's component model
  and how it can help us reason about our code.
  
Code your tools: Making your own VS Code extensions
  Built on top of TypeScript, VS Code makes it easy for web developers to build extensions
  using it's tools and API. In this lightning talk I go over how you can start
  extending the editor to your liking and not have to wait for others to build extensions you need.
    
Making React front-end flexible for changing requirements

"This code does not exist"

Automatic code formatters on the rise (though maybe only in the JS world), solves problems in teams, fixes issues before they happen.

Problem-solution ordering issues (http://mkremins.github.io/blog/doors-headaches-intellectual-need/)

Mutation is okay if it's encapsulated and isolated
  
How could we improve and simplify integration testing for UI. Cypress, Selenium, unit tests, dont test logic, test what the user
would do, using property based testing, fuzzy testing, just having smoke tests? mutation testing https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/MutationAnalysis.html

Show the path of code/execution all the way from clicking a button rendered in React to the network request, to the server response and back.
